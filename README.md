### 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using SVM (Machine Learning)

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the PIMA Diabetes Dataset.  
The dataset contains medical measurements such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, insulin, and more.  

The model preprocesses the data, standardizes it, trains an SVM classifier, evaluates accuracy, and finally makes predictions on new input data.  

### 🚀 Features

✔ Loads and explores diabetes dataset  
✔ Splits data into training & testing sets  
✔ Standardizes features using StandardScaler  
✔ Trains an SVM classifier (linear kernel)  
✔ Evaluates accuracy  
✔ Predicts diabetes for new user input  
✔ Clean and easy-to-understand code  

### 📊 Model Accuracy
Dataset	         Accuracy  
Training Set	  ~78.6%  
Testing Set    	  ~77.2%  

These values may vary slightly depending on environment and random seed.
